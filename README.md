## Software Engineering Class

Repository for Team Lucky 7s:
- Laura Barber
- Michael Blackburn
- Venessa Johansen-Barrera

Contains student-created test materials for readthedocs.org.

Repository structured according to Team Project Specifications. Should be the same as on SVN. 

** Currently this only works if the text files containg the tested urls are in the same directory as test.py. We need to figure out a way to reference it from a path, as it needs to be structured differently. **
